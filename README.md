##  --Connect Four Game--

## Technology Choice

Chose Java for object-oriented design and built-in logging capabilities. 

I wanted to showcase my Java abilities and focus on creating solid, testable game logic. 
While I didn't have time to implement a GUI, I prioritized clean code structure and comprehensive testing.
